Oh great, B.U.F.F. infected us with ransomware! They sent a message saying they planted a flag containing the key to decrypt out data somewhere on our website.

Hint: Maybe if you could see the URL you'll have better luck.

Hint:Michael's favorite Winter Olympic sport is that one where they use a broom to sweep the ice in front of those stones with handles. I'm not sure what it's called...
