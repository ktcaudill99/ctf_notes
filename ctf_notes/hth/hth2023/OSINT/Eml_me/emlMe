Hey Friend,

Did you hear?! Ed Skoudis is the keynote at Hackers Teaching Hackers 2023. I just read the post from the conference founder, John Harper on LinkedIn. Check it out: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harperjohn_i-am-super-stoked-to-have-ed-skoudis-as-a-activity-7103223406459817984--lsA

Hope to see you at the conference!

Your Best Pal,

P.S. I hear the CTF is going to be great. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
